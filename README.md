# Digital-Image-Processing
Here are some implementations for Digital Image Processing.

1. Gradient of Gray Scale Intensities: gray_scale_gradients.c
2. Create a chessboard of dynamic size: chessboard.c
3. Rotate a given image: rotate.c
4. Zoom in an image by a factor: zoom.c
5. Zoom out by skiping alternate pixels(by a factor): skiping_reduce.c
6. Draw a circle at center of an image: circle.c
7. Draw and fill an ellipse at center of an image: ellipse.c
8. Create histogram of an image: histogram.c
9. Mosiacing an image (vertical and horizontal): mosiacing.c
10. Shearing an image: shearing.c
11. Histogram Equalization of an image: histogram_equalization.c
12. Discrete Fourier Transform of an Image: dft.m
